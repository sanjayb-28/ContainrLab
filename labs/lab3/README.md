# Lab 3: Multi-Stage Builds

Level up your Docker skills by converting the starter image into a lean multi-stage build. The sample app is a small Express server that serves a `/health` endpoint. The current Dockerfile installs everything in a single stage which leaves development dependencies and build tooling inside the final image.

## Your Goals

1. **Split the Dockerfile into at least two stages.** Name the first stage `builder` (or similar) and keep dependency installs and build tooling there.
2. **Produce a slim runtime image.** Copy only the compiled `dist/` output and the production dependencies into the final stage. Aim for an image smaller than **250&nbsp;MB**.
3. **Expose the server correctly.** The container should continue to listen on port `8080` and run `npm start`.
4. **Keep the health endpoint working.** `curl http://localhost:8080/health` must return `200`.

## Tips

- Install dependencies reproducibly in the builder stage (`npm install` is fine; add a lockfile if you prefer `npm ci`). In the runtime stage install only production dependencies (e.g. `npm install --omit=dev`).
- `npm run build` already emits the compiled assets into `dist/`.
- Alpine or distroless base images keep the final image small, but remember Node distroless images do not ship with `/bin/sh`.
- If you copy the whole project in the runtime stage, the image will still be largeâ€”copy only what you need.

Good luck! When the judge runs, it will fail if the Dockerfile is still single-stage, if the final image is too large, or if the health endpoint stops responding.

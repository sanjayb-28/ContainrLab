### üìö Create Labs

New Docker labs are always welcome! See [Creating New Labs](#creating-new-labs) below.

### üîß Fix Issues

1. **Find an issue** - Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
2. **Comment** - Let us know you're working on it
3. **Fork & Branch** - Create a feature branch
4. **Code** - Follow our [Code Guidelines](#code-guidelines)
5. **Test** - Ensure all tests pass
6. **Submit PR** - Follow the [PR Process](#pull-request-process)

---

## Code Guidelines

### General Principles

- ‚úÖ **Write clean, readable code** - Others will maintain it
- ‚úÖ **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase style
- ‚úÖ **Keep changes focused** - One feature/fix per PR
- ‚úÖ **Test your changes** - Don't break existing functionality
- ‚úÖ **Document complex logic** - Help future contributors

### Python (Backend/Runner)

```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints
# Write docstrings for functions

def create_session(user_id: str, lab_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Create a new lab session for a user.
    
    Args:
        user_id: Unique identifier for the user
        lab_id: Identifier for the lab to start
        
    Returns:
        Session details including container ID and connection info
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)

```typescript
// Use TypeScript for type safety
// Follow Next.js conventions
// Use functional components with hooks

interface SessionProps {
  sessionId: string;
  labId: string;
}

export default function Session({ sessionId, labId }: SessionProps) {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### Docker

```dockerfile
# Use specific image versions (not :latest in production)
# Order layers for optimal caching
# Minimize image size
# Add security best practices

FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies first (cached)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code last (changes frequently)
COPY . .
```

## Creating New Labs

Labs are the core learning content. Here's how to create one:

### Lab Structure

```
labs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lab4/                        # New lab directory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json            # Lab configuration
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ instructions.md          # Student-facing instructions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace/               # Starter files for students
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile.starter
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solution/                # Reference solution
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ judge/                   # Validation tests
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ judge.py
```

### 1. Create metadata.json

```json
{
  "id": "lab4",
  "title": "Your Lab Title",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "description": "Brief description of what students will learn",
  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand X concept",
    "Apply Y technique",
    "Build Z from scratch"
  ],
  "prerequisites": ["lab1", "lab2"],
  "estimated_time_minutes": 30,
  "tags": ["docker", "optimization", "security"]
}
```

### 2. Write instructions.md

```markdown
# Lab 4: Your Lab Title

## Learning Objectives
- Learn concept A
- Practice skill B
- Build feature C

## Background
Explain the Docker concept you're teaching...

## Requirements
Your Dockerfile must:
- [ ] Use Alpine Linux as base image
- [ ] Install Python 3.11
- [ ] Copy application files
- [ ] Expose port 8000
- [ ] Set proper CMD

## Getting Started
1. Review the starter files in `/workspace`
2. Edit the Dockerfile
3. Click "Submit" to validate

## Hints
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Order layers by change frequency
```

### 3. Create Workspace

Provide starter files students will edit:

```
workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Application code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile.starter  # Template to complete
```

### 4. Provide Reference Solution

```dockerfile
# solution/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 5. Write Judge Tests

```python
# judge/judge.py
"""
Automated validation for Lab 4
"""

def validate_dockerfile(dockerfile_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Validate student's Dockerfile meets requirements.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "passed": bool,
            "score": int,
            "feedback": [str],
            "errors": [str]
        }
    """
    feedback = []
    errors = []
    score = 0
    
    with open(dockerfile_path) as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Check base image
    if "FROM python:3.11-alpine" in content:
        feedback.append("‚úÖ Correct base image")
        score += 20
    else:
        errors.append("‚ùå Must use python:3.11-alpine as base image")
    
    # Check WORKDIR
    if "WORKDIR" in content:
        feedback.append("‚úÖ WORKDIR set")
        score += 20
    else:
        errors.append("‚ùå Missing WORKDIR instruction")
    
    # Add more checks...
    
    return {
        "passed": len(errors) == 0 and score >= 80,
        "score": score,
        "feedback": feedback,
        "errors": errors
    }
```

### 6. Test Your Lab

```bash
# Start a local session
docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.yml up

# Navigate to your lab
# Complete it as a student would
# Verify judge validation works correctly
# Check AI hints are helpful
```

### 7. Submit Your Lab

1. Create PR with your lab
2. Include screenshots
3. Explain learning objectives
4. Link to any reference materials
